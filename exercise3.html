     <h1>Article 1</h1>
     <p>A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language. 
         From the program in its human-readable form of source code, a compiler or assembler can 
         derive machine codeâ€”a form consisting of instructions that the computer can directly execute. 
         Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter.

        Computers manufactured until the 1970s had front-panel switches for programming. 
        The computer program was written on paper for reference. An instruction was 
        represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, 
        an execute button was pressed.<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/09/06/21/42/code-4457480_960_720.jpg" width="300"height="300" alt="code" align="right">
